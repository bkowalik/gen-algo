Graph vertex colouring problem
----------

This program is project for study subject called Decisional Algorithms and Complexity Theory. We are to make genetics algorithm to solve the NP-complete problem of vertex colouring in graph. Our solution is universal and can be applied to almost every graph due to abstraction layer. Maybe later we will improve it.
